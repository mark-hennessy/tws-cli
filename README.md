# tws-cli

A C# command-line interface for the IB Trader Workstation trading platform.

I built this app to help me execute trades faster since I found Trader Workstation to be a bit clunky on a laptop. The app tracks a single ticker symbol at a time and can calculate the quantity of shares to trade based off of a cash value. The app makes it easy to buy, sell, reverse, and close positions.

The app is built on top of an example [API client](http://interactivebrokers.github.io) provided by IB. The example client was difficult to work with because it used onStart/onUpdate/onEnd method hooks instead of async callbacks. I mapped these method hooks to events and then mapped the events to C# Task and TaskCompletionSource objects (sort of like Promises in JS). This allowed me to write asynchrounous code that was easy to work with and reason about. It also allowed me to use the awesome async/await keywords so that I could write asynchronous code as if it were normal synchronous code. Even if you don't plan on using my app, the source code is a great example for how to use the TWS API since there are very few examples online.

## Prerequisites

To use the app you must have a brokerage account with [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php). You must also have Trader Workstation installed and running on the same machine. This is so that the app can open a localhost TCP connection with Trader Workstation and send messages back and forth using the Trader Workstation [API](http://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/index.html).
